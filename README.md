# Possible-Predictors-of-HDL-Cholesterol-in-Adult-Females
Part II of the second data science project completed for Statistical Methods I. National Health &amp; Nutrition Examination Survey 2017-2022 (NHANES 2017-2022) data was used to build and compare two linear regression models predicting HDL cholesterol in females ages 30 - 55.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
-  Clean data set, investigating and making appropriate decisions about missing data
-  Create well-labeled and attractive visualizations of outcome, investigating potential transformations of that outcome
-  Define a research question related to how effectively your key predictor predicts your quantitative outcome, while (possibly) adjusting for the other predictors
-  Develop two competitive linear regression models - one with key predictor and another with additional predictors
-  Use statistical model to make predictions and assess the quality of those predictions
-  Assess model performance including predictive performance, adherence to assumptions, and predictive quality
-  Describe study limitations and next steps
